Changelog Modular Exo

General
* Exo can jump by default, does not start with thrusters

Weapons
* Readded single version weapons again
* Mix and match weapons per side with the exclusion that minigun model can never mix with railgun (model limitation) and no dual-claw/fist
* Added Welder (uses railgun model) - behaves exactly like regular welder
* Added Flamethrower (uses railgun model) - behaviour exactly like regular flamethrower but uses heat up mechanics instead of fuel. 
* Added Exo Shield (uses the claw weapon)- Absorbs ranged attacks protecting marines behind it while heat isn't full. Recharges out of combat.
* Railgun 
	- Dual railguns can fire simultaneously
	- Non-charge damage increased to 35 from 10
* Minigun 
	- Base damage increased to 8 from 6
	- Heat up rate halved 

Modules
* Armour modules adds an extra 250 armour with 0.15 weight penalty. This is applied AFTER armour upgrades
* Thruster module (shift only, no spacebar) much more maneauverable than vanilla with weight penalty 0.05. Affected by weight with same formula.
* Phase module enables exos to use phasegates and also be beaconed with weight penalty 0.1
* Nano Repair module enables repair for cost of fuel with weight penalty 0.1
* Catalyst ability when active gives nearby marines the catalyst effect for up to 6 seconds. They lose it if the exo dies, fuel runs out or exo deactives it.
* Nano Shield ability when active gives nearby marines the nanoshield (-50% damage) effect for up to 6 seconds. They lose it if the exo dies, fuel runs out or exo deactives it.

Weight and speed

* Claw 0 
* Welder 0.02 
* Shield 0.1
* Railgun 0.05 
* Minigun 0.15 
* Flamethrower 0.15 
* Armor module 0.15
* Phase module 0.1
* Nano repair module 0.1
* Thruster 0.05
* Nano Shield 0.1
* Catpack 0.1

Sample weight calculation


Single Railgun + Thruster = 8 * (1 - (0.05 + 0.05)) = 7.2
Dual Minigun + Armor module = 8 * (1 - (0.15 + 0.15 + 0.1)) = 4.8
Flame + Railgun + Phase module = 8 * (1-(0.15 + 0.05 + 0.1) = 5.6
